### Get the latest version
Please get the latest node_exporter version here: https://prometheus.io/download/#node_exporter \
And put it to the link after `wget` command in download_node_exporter.sh

### Caveats
1. The node exporter runs at port 9100
2. Make sure the collectors' IP (e.g. Prometheus) is allowed at Firewall.
